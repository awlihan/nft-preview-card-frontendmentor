## Overview

This is my submission for the NFT preview card challenge.

For a bit of backstory on me, I just learn web development for about a month or so and haven't made any project on my own before this one.

I finished this project in about 2 hours (but it felt longer haha), quite close to my target time.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started by typing out the html which seemed really easy but I change it a multiple amount of time when I was working on the css.

Then I started working on the css, I start by importing the fonts and a simple reset. After that I make the card background and using css grid I split the card into two rows (one for the picture and one for the text). The next part is pretty straight-forward, or at-least should be because I need to do a lot of troubleshooting. A lot of the properties that I type first of all didn't seem to work how I wanted so I need to resort to some sort of "hacky" (I do not know the right word to describe it, basically just using brute force by trying to find the right number, especially for the positioning for the price and time) solution.

After I was satisfied with the css, I move on to the hover state. It was not that difficult, but I stumbled on the hover state for the before and after pseudo element because I write it as .image::before:after instead of .image:hover::before.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that I still have a long way to go to be comfortable using HTML and CSS. I still need to google a lot of simple stuff when I was working on this challenge. I hope in the future I can go back on this project and make a significantly better code.

### Continued development

- Need to research about flexbox more.
- Working with an image can be kinda hard for me so I need to find a reliable way other than just going head first without thought.
- Positioning items and elements could be better and need to find a simpler way.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) I use this a lot when I am working on this project. The references really put some sense into the code that I was writing.
